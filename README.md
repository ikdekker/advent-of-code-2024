## Analysis

### Day 1

#### Part 1
O(nlogn) complexity due to sorting the lists
#### Part 2
O(n) for counting the frequency and iterating the list

### Day 2

#### part 1
Complexity O(n), just looping over all numbers, slight optimization by breaking if a violation is caught

#### part 2
This is also O(n), we just do two loops, one for decrements, one for increments and some extra ops to determine how to continue.


### Day 3

O(n)..

### Day 4

O(n*m)..
